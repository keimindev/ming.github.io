<p>When I first started developing, I loved the idea of creating products that could make a difference in peopleâ€™s daily lives. I always prioritize user value, focusing on user-friendly designs and working hard to solve problems. Iâ€™m always eager to embrace change and new challenges.</p>

<p>As a frontend developer, Iâ€™ve enjoyed, experienced, and strived for the following: <br />
â–ª I thrive in environments where I can work proactively and responsibly. <br /> 
â–ª I work hard to be a trusted colleague through communication and constant growth in my technical skills. <br /> 
â–ª I also enjoy receiving code reviews. <br /> 
â–ª Iâ€™m comfortable using various communication tools like Figma, Slack, Notion, and Jira.<br /> 
â–ª Iâ€™m always looking for better ways to do things. <br /> 
â–ª Although Iâ€™m still learning, I frequently write to improve my documentation skills. <br /></p>
