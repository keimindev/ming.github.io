<p><strong>How can I grow up for Developer?</strong></p>

<p>That’s a question I asked myself. I thought about building my own service, something simple like a stopwatch. It’s not a huge project; I just needed that kind of service and decided to keep updating it. I have no idea about the backend part, like the database and API. Still, I wanted to make it myself, even if it’s a bit slow. In reality, I’m actively working on designing the database, considering different aspects, and creating it step by step whenever needed. It’s a slow process, but it’s incredibly satisfying.</p>

<p><strong>Having a strong inner self</strong></p>

<p>I got a job offer after leaving the company. (I thought it was destiny). It’s project manager role, to put it simply. It’s really great opportunity,  but it’s quite different from my previous work experiences. I’m currently very satisfied with my development work, and I want to continue doing it. However, I concerns about future rent payments and the anxiety of what if i can’t find a work. I debated whether to accept a tempting offer, thinking that if i miss this opportunity, I might regret it later. I wondered if having a strong inner self could help ease this anxiety and impatience. The thought crossed my mind that if I can firmly establish my own thoughts, I wouldn’t be swayed easily. I want to be someone who doesn’t get swayed easily and has a clear mindset.</p>

<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>

<p>My reading goal of this year is to read at least ten books.</p>

<p>Reduce my body far percentage to below 20% this year.</p>
