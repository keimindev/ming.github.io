Min 🐰

I am a frontend developer living in Seoul, South Korea. </br>
I prioritize creating better user value rather than simply making a product. </br>
The blog serves as documentation about my programming journey 🎒. </br>
Additionally, I love learning about web technology, but I often forget that it's the reason why I'm writing. </br>
I'm looking to record questions and thoughts to ponder.</br>
</br>
love cute things from all around the world 🌍</br>
