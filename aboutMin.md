### ðŸ‘‹Â Hi, Iâ€™m Frontend Developer - based out of South Korea

When I first started developing, I loved the idea of creating products that could make a difference in people's daily lives. I always prioritize user value, focusing on user-friendly designs and working hard to solve problems. I'm always eager to embrace change and new challenges.

As a frontend developer, I've enjoyed, experienced, and strived for the following:

â–ª I thrive in environments where I can work proactively and responsibly. </br> 
â–ª I work hard to be a trusted colleague through communication and constant growth in my technical skills. </br>
â–ª I also enjoy receiving code reviews.</br>
â–ª I'm comfortable using various communication tools like Figma, Slack, Notion, and Jira.</br>
â–ª I'm always looking for better ways to do things. </br>
â–ª Although I'm still learning, I frequently write to improve my documentation skills. </br>
