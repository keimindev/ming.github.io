### 👋 Hi, I’m Frontend Developer - based out of South Korea

When I first started developing, I loved the idea of creating products that could make a difference in people's daily lives. I always prioritize user value, focusing on user-friendly designs and working hard to solve problems. I'm always eager to embrace change and new challenges.

As a frontend developer, I've enjoyed, experienced, and strived for the following:

▪ I thrive in environments where I can work proactively and responsibly. <br> 
▪ I work hard to be a trusted colleague through communication and constant growth in my technical skills.
▪ I also enjoy receiving code reviews.
▪ I'm comfortable using various communication tools like Figma, Slack, Notion, and Jira.
▪ I'm always looking for better ways to do things. 
▪ Although I'm still learning, I frequently write to improve my documentation skills.
