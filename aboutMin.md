### ðŸ‘‹Â Hi, Iâ€™m Frontend Developer - based out of South Korea

For the past two years, I have worked as a frontend developer, utilizing JavaScript-based React and Next.js to implement, develop, deploy, and operate web services. Throughout the development process, I have prioritized the value of users and consistently strived for code optimization and problem-solving.

In addition, I have experience attending numerous business meetings to contribute to business growth. I have also made efforts to efficiently collaborate with team members to advance projects. Are you looking for a developer who can work independently as well as a team player? Let's take the first step towards success together.

- Experience migrating from Flutter to React.js
- Legacy code maintenance (memory usage management, prevention of API call overload)
- Operation and deployment of services in AWS cloud environments
