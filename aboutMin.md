I am a frontend developer living in Seoul, South Korea. 
I prioritize creating better user value rather than simply making a product. 
The blog serves as documentation about my programming journey 🎒. 
Additionally, I love learning about web technology, but I often forget that it's the reason why I'm writing. 
I'm looking to record questions and thoughts to ponder.

love cute things from all around the world 🌍</br>
